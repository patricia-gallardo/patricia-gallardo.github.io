**CW: Sexual harassment and a certain convicted rapist in the C++ community**

Hi,

I have something to say, something that I've only told a handful of people since it happened several years ago. Ideally,
I should've come out with this much sooner, and for that I apologize, but this is an extremely difficult subject for me
to discuss. I don't consider what happened to me to be particularly "severe," considering the kinds of things that could
have happened, or have happened to others in similar situations. Nonetheless, I am writing about it now to raise
awareness as it concerns the governance of ISO/INCITS and what I believe is a longstanding, deeply entrenched cultural
problem within the wider C++ community and with leadership in the community.

### The Incident

I was sexually harassed by a prominent member of WG21 (the ISO C++ committee) at an in-person meeting several years ago.
This person (who I will call "Dick"[^1]) was a subgroup chair at the time. To briefly summarize: I had met Dick shortly
before the meeting at another community event, where we bonded over shared interests. At the WG21 meeting, he asked me
for kisses.[^2] I rejected him (by attempting to ignore the inappropriate behavior), and instead of dropping the matter,
he escalated: he demanded that I explain my reasons for rejecting him, seeking me out multiple times at the venue to do
so, and harassed me via text messages for several weeks after the meeting, even after I had told him that his advances
were unwelcome. His antics during the week of the meeting and his apparent obsession with me (as evidenced by the long,
rambling texts he sent me) made me so uncomfortable that I became concerned for my personal safety.

I am fortunate that nothing more came of this unpleasant experience, as he eventually stopped his harassment, but sadly,
I was all too willing to ignore his initial inappropriate request. I myself did not want to believe that this man, who
had up to this point behaved as a friend, and who I respected professionally, would disregard my own wishes and
boundaries so completely. And I felt especially vulnerable as a young woman, alone and far away from home, who felt
intimidated and out of her depth at her very first WG21 meeting.

### WG21's Response

Several months after the meeting, I finally worked up the courage to report Dick's harassment to WG21. Due to the nature
of my allegations (which Dick himself did not deny to WG21), and the evidence that I presented (Dick's inappropriate
text messages), my Code of Conduct complaint eventually resulted in Dick's removal from his leadership position as
subgroup chair, which I suppose is a positive outcome. But the way the matter was handled by Herb Sutter (the WG21
convenor) and the committee still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. Most egregiously, Herb never fully explained the
remedies that were available to me in the ISO Code of Conduct process (namely that I would have to escalate the matter
to ISO in order to actually accomplish anything, e.g. ejecting a WG21 member), and he also never informed me of Dick's
removal as subgroup chair.

(I learned about it, like everyone else on the committee, from an announcement email on the ISO C++ reflector, where the
news of him stepping down was "batched" with a bunch of other organizational updates. Due to the way the email was
written and other rumors that were circulating at the time, I was actually uncertain that my report had anything to do
with Dick's removal and I spent the following years feeling extremely discouraged as a result.)

To this day, Dick remains a very active participant in WG21, and as far as I know, he still struggles with understanding
the very concept of sexual harassment.

But, like I said, worse things could have happened. I didn't suffer physical harm. As unsatisfying as the outcome was, I
didn't want to waste anymore of my life dwelling on it. And so I tried to forget about the incident, simply resigning
myself to the fact that I could never participate in WG21 meetings again so long as the person who sexually harassed me
would be present.

### ISO's Response

Up until this point, I was under the impression that WG21 had considered the question of Dick's continued membership in
WG21 and decided in his favor. It wasn't until early in 2022,
after [Patricia Aas blew the whistle on the Standard C++ Foundation protecting a convicted rapist and registered sex offender](https://patricia.no/2022/03/08/cppcon.html)
, and that same convicted rapist later officially joining WG21, that I came to understand that WG21 had essentially zero
power to limit participation.

And so, several years after the incident in question, I finally decided to contact my national body and file a formal
ISO Code of Conduct complaint, which they sent to Dick's national body on my behalf.

I am sure the fact that I had waited several years to make my ISO complaint had a negative effect on my complaint's
resolution. I was also told that my complaint was ISO's first-ever known case of sexual harassment,[^3] which didn't
help my confidence. The response that I eventually received from Dick's national body was patronizing; they acknowledged
the seriousness of Dick's misconduct but were concerned about "due process," "double jeopardy," and "proportionality,"
and so they said they would simply require Dick to take diversity training,[^4] and declined to take any further action.

Maybe this was the best that someone in my situation could have hoped for, but I felt this response trivialized what I
had gone through, and did nothing to address my safety concerns. ("Diversity training" is not an effective or proven
means of changing problematic behavior.) So I attempted to escalate my case to a higher body (the ISO Technical
Management Board), only to be met with a similar response (they declined to get involved).

### Some Reflections

Having exhausted ISO's entire Code of Conduct process by now, I feel slightly foolish for having hoped for a better
outcome. At the very least, I was hoping they would consider my suggestion of a ban from in-person meetings or ejecting
Dick from his national body for at least a year (which is one of the suggested penalties in ISO's own Code of Conduct
guidance). Really, I was open to anything more substantial than a one-time "diversity training" session.

But no, I was told by my own national body (who was supposed to advocate for me) that any further consequences would be
excessive and inappropriate.

And maybe that's true? Maybe my expectations and my concerns about personal safety (and the safety of others) were
unreasonable? Maybe I should trust that diversity training will successfully teach Dick to not proposition women at
professional events? I don't know anymore.

Generally speaking, I am not against allowing an offender the opportunity to learn from their misconduct. In an ideal
world, everyone should be allowed that opportunity. However, in the real world, this often comes at the expense of the
victims of such behavior. Communities and institutions are often focused on the possibility of "rehabilitating" an
offender (sometimes going to great lengths to excuse or downplay misconduct, while only performing a token effort to
prevent another offense), while victims' concerns are minimized or ignored.

Moreover, any potential "redemption" requires that the offender is capable of introspection and is actually willing to
put in the work to learn and grow from their experience. And for that to happen, the offender has to first acknowledge
the harm that they have caused. Given that, in his last communication with me, Dick had the audacity to be offended that
I refused a (completely unexpected and unsolicited) birthday gift, I think it is unlikely that Dick will ever admit
fault and take responsibility for the way he has treated me.

Lastly, I don't know who needs to hear this, but Dick's behavior towards me was _not_ harmless. This entire ordeal has
already affected my career (e.g., as previously mentioned, I can no longer represent my employer at WG21 meetings). On a
personal level, I am much more wary and guarded around men who I don't know well. And the trust I had in certain leaders
and institutions has perhaps been irreparably damaged.

### A Warning

If you are currently a participant in WG21, or are thinking of joining or participating in the committee in the future (
and particularly if you are also a woman or femme-presenting), I honestly don't want my story to dissuade you from being
a part of the standardization process. I sincerely hope that you feel welcomed and respected by your WG21 colleagues.

However, in the unfortunate event that something similar does happen to you, here are my notes:

- First of all, **it's not your fault.** You didn't ask to be treated this way. The Dicks of the world are grown adults
  who should know better.
- Should you choose to report, **the people in ISO responding to your complaint will (probably) have close to zero
  experience dealing with such matters** and may not treat your case with the gravity that it deserves.
- **ISO's own Code of Conduct process is not designed with such scenarios in mind** (e.g., where the personal safety of
  one party may be threatened by another), and may ultimately fail to protect you while protecting the offender.
- On the whole, **I perceive a lack of motivation/urgency on ISO's part to address the previous two items above,**
  especially as it relates to the participation of a known, convicted rapist in WG21[^5] (though I acknowledge that such
  organizations are slow-moving by nature and that I don't know what discussions are happening behind closed doors).
  Even if my perception is incorrect, which I hope is the case, it will take an excruciatingly long time for changes to
  materialize.

If something more serious than sexual harassment were to occur (like stalking or sexual assault), I have my doubts that
ISO will do anything more than shrug and suggest reporting to the police, instead of making sure that the victim is able
to continue participating in ISO without fearing for their safety.

### A Call to Action?

I don't pretend that I know what the ideal solution is, for any of the situations that I described. (After all, I am
only a programmer and not an expert on human behavior.) All I can do is describe a set of problems, with the hope that
people more experienced and qualified than I am will come along with a concrete plan to address them.

As I see it, these problems (which are sadly not specific to the C++ community) include:

- Some people in the community still think certain behaviors (like sexually harassing women at a professional event) are
  okay.
- Some people in the community (including leadership) are hesitant to call out bad behavior or enact stronger
  consequences against bad actors, and—for some reason—are focused on the needs/inclusion of bad actors (to the
  detriment of the people that are negatively impacted by them).
- Institutions like ISO/INCITS don't currently protect victims and are slow to adapt to changing times.

ISO and INCITS: if you are truly serious
about [diversity and inclusion](https://www.iso.org/strategy2030/key-areas-of-work/diversity-and-inclusion/women-in-standards.html) (
and especially about increasing the representation of women within ISO), I urge you to consider the impact of your
decisions regarding bad actors (like Dick and now Individual X), whose continued involvement in your organizations may
cause women to reconsider their own participation. Moreover, though I recognize that these issues are complex and
fraught with legal complications, it's my opinion that outright forbidding discussion on the topic of Individual X by
rank-and-file members (by enforcing rules against "disparagement," as ISO/INCITS has been doing these past few months),
as well as making any sanctioned discussions (which I understand has been happening in secret between members of the
INCITS Executive Board) completely opaque to interested parties is, at the very least, damaging to your D&I efforts, and
only reinforces the perception that your organizations are uninterested in changing in any meaningful way.

As for everyone else: if you share my concerns, I believe the best thing you can do is to simply call out bad behavior
when you see/learn about it, and to not let it go unchallenged. If you are in a position to raise awareness or effect
positive change, please don't let personal discomfort or inconvenience stop you from having this much-needed
conversation and moving the needle on the current state of affairs.

Sincerely,

TL;DR: I was sexually harassed by a WG21 member, I reported it, and ISO thought it was a good idea to simply assign
Creepy McCreepFace "diversity training." Does ISO think this is a good practice going forward that will entice more
women to join ISO? Who knows. (Also, doing nothing about a certain convicted rapist on the committee will definitely
help! /s)

[^1]: I am not directly naming the person who sexually harassed me at this time, due to concerns about my privacy.
[^2]: I distinctly remember him clarifying that he wanted me to kiss him "on the lips."
[^3]: I have my doubts that this is actually true, as it seems difficult to believe, given ISO's long history.
[^4]: I had to ask for clarification on whether this "diversity training" (which was described in extremely vague terms) would include sexual harassment.
[^5]: I realize that the facts of my experience with Dick and the situation with Individual X are different, but I feel that the responses to both are related.
