The signatories of this letter have reviewed the [Include <C++> Transparency Report on CppCon Safety][1], and support the
steps taken by [#include <C++>][8] outlined in their [Include <C++> Position on CppCon Safety][2] and the requirements they
outline in the section [What Needs to Change][3] therein.

We do this with the sincere hopes that a conference we have enjoyed, and an organization we have trusted for many years,
can take the steps needed to regain that trust.

Signed
