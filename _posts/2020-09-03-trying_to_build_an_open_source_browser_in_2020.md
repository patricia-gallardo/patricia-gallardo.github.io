A lot of things have been developed over the last 15 years that should make the process of making a browser easier. In this talk we will explore a bunch of different tools, platforms and libraries that could go into making a browser in 2020.

We will also see a live demo of a simple browser built with these OSS projects. We will also discuss the limitations and future work needed to make this work in practice.
